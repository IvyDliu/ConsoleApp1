3.
    Managed resources are memories that Garbage Collector is responsible to clean up, unmanaged resources are memories that are not.
4.
    Clean up memories that no other object is pointing at.
    
Controlling Flow and Converting Types
1.  System.DivideByZeroException
2.  the variable is now infinity
3.  the variable is now negative
4.  x=y first then y = y+1; y = y+1 first then x = y
5.  break: exit loop; continue: next iteration; return: exit function
6.   initialize, test, and update. only test is required
7.  = assign, == comparison
8. yes
9. means default
10. IEnumerable

Arrays and Strings
1.
    when need to update string frequently, use StringBuilder; otherwise, use string
2.
    Array
3.
    Array.Sort()
4.
    Length
5.
    No. But it can store the derived data types
6.
    Copyto( ) copies the source array to desitination array. Clone() copies the array and returns the new object.
